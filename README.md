# Traffic Simulator

### Description
* Second homework of the Parallel and Distributed Algorithms course.
* The project consists of different traffic situations that need to be solved using various synchronization techniques.
* The objectives of the project were:
	* Handling different traffic situations using synchronization primitives, such as barriers, semaphores and locks
	* Getting used to parallel programming in Java
	* Dealing with concurrency issues

### Languages
* The project was developed using parallel programming in Java
